Additionally, Make sure to delete or comment out any code you add to this notebook for testing purposes prior to submitting the notebook to Gradescope. Failure to do so may crash the autograder. \n","</div>\n","\n","\n","All instructions, code comments, etc. in this notebook **are part of the assignment instructions**. That is, if there is instructions about completing a task in this notebook, that task is not optional.  \n","\n","\n","\n","<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-info\">\n","    You <strong>must</strong> implement the following functions in this notebook to receive credit.\n","</div>\n","\n","`user()`\n","\n","`load_data()`\n","\n","`exclude_no_pickup_locations()`\n","\n","`exclude_no_trip_distance()`\n","\n","`include_fare_range()`\n","\n","`get_highest_tip()`\n","\n","`get_total_toll()`\n","\n","Each method will be auto-graded using different sets of parameters or data, to ensure that values are not hard-coded.  You may assume we will only use your code to work with data from NYC Taxi Trips during auto-grading. You do not need to write code for unreasonable scenarios.  \n","\n","Since the overall correctness of your code will require multiple function to work together correctly (i.e., all methods are interdepedent), implementing only a subset of the functions likely will lead to a low score.\n","\n","### Helper functions\n","\n","You should not use - and do not need - any helper functions; implement the required functions by completing the function skeletons below. All of the fuctions you implement should be self-contained; each function should carry all of the code it needs to execute on its expected input(s) within its body. \n","\n","### Kernel Selection\n","\n","Be sure that you select the PySpark kernel from the kernel options above, if it is not already selected. Do not use the Python3 kernel. The notebook should default to the PySpark kernel. \n","\n","### GCP and Gradescope\n","For submitting to Gradescope, you should use spark dataframes and dataframe operations _only_. \n","You should not use SQL. \n","\n","### SparkSession Objects and SparkContexts\n","Note that you have access to a SparkSession object in the notebook environment in virtue of using the PySpark kernel. It can be referenced using the variable name _spark_ and does not need to be explicitly created or defined. This beavior can be leveraged to read in the initial dataset. \n","\n","You should not need to invoke _spark_ in any of your functions but the load_data() function. Do not hardcode references to _spark_ into any of your functions except for the load_data() function. \n","\n","### Assumptions Regarding Function Inputs\n","This question assumes that you're carrying the results of your prior work foward at each stage of data preparation and analysis. Thus, the _input_ to each of the _filtering_ functions below should be the _output_ of the _prior_ function. The inputs to the two analytical functions should be the output of the last filtering function.
