# Burrito Builder

An interactive web application that optimizes burrito ingredients by visualizing cost and environmental impact trade-offs. I developed this as part of a team project, and this repository contains my implementation and contributions to the codebase.

## Live Demo

## About The Project

I created the Burrito Builder as part of a team exploration into food supply chain optimization. The application empowers consumers to make informed decisions by providing real-time visualization of how ingredient choices affect both cost and environmental impact. My contributions focused on developing the interactive visualization components and implementing the optimization algorithm.

## Key Features I Developed

- Interactive D3.js visualizations for cost and environmental impact analysis
- Real-time Pareto front optimization display
- Global ingredient sourcing map with interactive features
- User interface for ingredient selection and budget constraints
- Environmental impact scoring system
- Integration with Google Analytics for user preference tracking

## Technical Implementation

### Data Pipeline
- UN Comtrade Database: International trade data
- Environmental impact datasets
- MIT Climate Portal transportation emissions data

### Technologies Used
- D3.js for interactive visualizations
- HTML/CSS for user interface
- NSGA-II algorithm for multi-objective optimization
- Google Analytics API for tracking user interactions

## How It Works

1. Select your location and preferred ingredients
2. Set your maximum budget
3. Explore different cost-environmental impact trade-offs using the interactive slider
4. View ingredient sourcing on the global map
5. Get detailed cost and emissions information
6. Confirm your selection

## Implementation Details

The application implements:
- Comprehensive ingredient cost calculations including transportation
- Environmental impact scoring combining production and transportation emissions
- NSGA-II algorithm optimization for finding optimal ingredient combinations
- Interactive data visualizations using D3.js
- Real-time user interaction tracking
